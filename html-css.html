      What are the differences between Relative, Absolute, and Fixed
      positioning?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Understanding CSS position first requires and understanding of CSS display
      property and CSS Box Model. <br /><br />
      Unless you understand why elements are placed where they are by default it
      is much harder to understand what you need to do in order to move them
      into the position you want. Assuming one understands these initial
      concepts let’s dive into the differences between Relative Absolute and
      Fixed positioning. Firstly there is one thing missing from that list and
      that is the default setting for all elements in CSS which is Static.
    </p>
    <h2>Static positioning</h2>
    <p>
      Here I have a simple codepen example that demonstrates the default
      “Static” position that these three divs are placed in when written in
      HTML. Divs are block level elements and so therefore each one of them is
      automatically given their own line as well as taking up the full width of
      their parent container. The height if the div is determined by the size of
      the content, in this case a very large "H2" and/or padding, border and
      margin according the box model concept. Because they’re static they follow
      the chronological order of the HTML document. Ie One, Two & then Three
      from top to bottom.
    </p>

      alt="Static positioning demo"
    />
    <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      This next example demonstrates relative positioning. You will notice I
      have added position: relative; into the #one rules as well as top: 400px;.
      What this means in simple terms is “position this element with 400px of
      distance between it and the original position it would be in if it was
      still static” “top” meaning “add this distance to the top of the element
      and which will move it downward”. Bottom, left and right can also be used
      to move the item in any direction. As you can also see all of the other
      elements haven’t moved. They are behaving as if Box One is still in it’s
      original position and they have left a space for it there. The properties
      bottom, left, and right can ofcoarse be used as well to move the element
      in any direction.
    </p>

      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/CSS-technical-concept-relative.png"
      alt="relative positioning demo"
    />
    <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      My third example here demonstrates absolute positioning. There are three
      main differences here between this and relative. First being that the div
      no longer takes up the full width of the parent container. The size is now
      only determined by the size of the content ie the large. The second being
      that the element has been removed from the normal flow of the document.
      Meaning that the space that would normally be left for it by the other
      elements is no longer there. They are behaving as if the element doesn’t
      exist. Thirdly the position of the element is determined relative to the
      edges of the body as opposed to the elements original position. ie 500px
      down from the top of the page and 200px from the left.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/CSS-concept-absolute.png"
      alt="ablsolute positioining demo"
    />
    <p>
      Something else to note here is that if there is no value given for top,
      bottom, left or right the element will still be placed in it’s original
      position. For example:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/CSS-technical-Absolute-no-value.png"
      alt="absolute positioning demo2"
    />
    <p>
      It is only once a value of 0 is given for both top and left that the
      element moves to the top left corner of the document as shown here:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/Absolute-0value-given .png"
      alt="absolute positioining demo3"
    />
    <h2>Fixed position</h2>
    <p>
      Fixed position is similar to absolute position in that it is removed from
      the normal flow of the document however the difference here is that
      (assuming the height of the page is larger than the viewport and you can
      scroll) the element will stay in the same position relative to the
      viewport (the edges of your viewing window) and allow everything to scroll
      up underneath it. For example:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/CSS-technical-fixed-scroll1.png"
      alt="fixed positioning demo"
      img
    />
    <img
      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/css-technical-fixed-scroll2.png"
      alt="fixed positioning demo2"
    />
    <img
      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/CSS-technical-fixed-scroll3 .png"
      alt="fixed positioning demo3"
    />
    <p>
      Similar to Absolute if there is no value given for top, bottom, left or
      right the element will still be placed in it’s original position. For
      example:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/CSS-technical-screenshots/CSS-technical-fixed-novalue.png"
      alt="fixed positioning demo4"
    />
    <p>
      In summary each of these position options have their uses. There is one
      other position option called “Sticky" but that is a topic for a whole
      different blog post. Sticky is a combination of relative positioning and
      fixed positioning and has a bunch of cool uses. Hopefully this has been
      informative and thanks for reading :)
