    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2>A time when I have been blocked on a problem</h2>
    <p>
      During one of the Javascript Kata exercises I really struggled with one
      challenge where I needed to determine wether a number was devisable by 3
      and/or 5. I tried writing out the steps of the solution in plain english
      with a solution that I thought would work. I felt frustrated and
      incompetent throughout the process because even though my solution could
      have worked I just didn’t have the experience to know how I would write
      make it work in Javascript. I learned that it will take time for me to
      feel a sense of self expression as a developer and for now I will still
      benefit from using more a experienced developer’s solutions.
    </p>
    <h2>A time when I have elegeantly solved a prolblem</h2>
    <p>
      During another one of these exercises I managed to find a solution to a
      problem completely on my own and I felt an immense sense of satisfaction.
      I broke the problem down into small parts and wrote it out in plain
      english, then solved each small part one by one. I tested each small part
      to make sure it was working as expected and in the end I found a solution
      to the whole problem. Sometimes I find it hard to maintain my train of
      thought and not get lost in my own code so one thing that really helped my
      was talking my self through the whole process out loud. Essentially
      explaining my own code back to myself, this helped me stay on track and
      think of what I need to figure out next in the solution.
    </p>
    <h2>One using various problem solving methods</h2>
    <p>
      I feel fairly confident using all of these problem solving techniques.
      I’ve learned when each technique comes in most useful. For example
      console.logging is really useful for making sure one small part of your
      solution is doing what you’re expecting it to. Reading error messages is
      useful when you have written something with incorrect syntax and
      introduced a bug. The error will usually tell you where your bug is found.
      Researching is something that I think will take time to master. Some of
      the documentation can be so full of technical terms that it’s hard to find
      what is relevant but I have managed to become familiar with some beginner
      friendly resources. All in all I am looking forward to becoming an
      effective problem solver, it is the aspect of my job that I have enjoyed
      no matter the field I have worked in so I’m looking forward to furthering
      these skills.
