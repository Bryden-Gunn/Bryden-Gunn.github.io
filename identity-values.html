    <h3>
      Moving away from the Avatar Community facing my destructive financial
      habits and paying off my debts.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Form the age of 14-23 My family and I were involved in a highly
      manipulative and controlling self development community called “The Avatar
      Course”. Very similar to Scientology in which people are enticed to sign
      up for 2-9 day seminars in which confidential materials are delivered to
      students as a course. Students are guided through some very powerful
      rundowns which often produce some extremely compelling experiences. Being
      that you are going through these experiences together you form a close
      bond with the group and an understanding between you that is unlike the
      typical relationships in our lives. Unfortunately despite the inherent
      value in some of the material the overall culture of the group was centred
      around bringing on more recruits and growing the organisation. We were
      made to feel as though it was imperative that we have more and more people
      go through these courses for the sake of the future of human-kind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The group would often place ones “spiritual evolution” above peoples
      financial well-being and over all mental health. Therefore people were
      often encouraged to take out bank loans or borrow money from wealthier
      members of the community in order to make it to these workshops. Taking
      the time to save up for the trip and going at a later date was always
      discouraged. Subsequently, like many others, I found myself in quite a bit
      of personal debt with no real means of paying it all back. Let alone at 23
      I had no tangible tertiary education hadn’t done any “OE” like many of my
      peers and was very mentally unstable. I knew that I needed to move on from
      this group, find myself a job, pay back all my debts and make a life for
      myself that was worth living on my own terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite also having a strong passion for music and wanting to get a degree
      in Jazz I knew that if I didn’t pay this debt off I would be in debt for
      most of my 20s and would have missed out on the basic joys of life as a
      young adult. So I found myself a customer service role at a bank and
      grinded my way to freedom. In total I owed approx. $13,000.00 and within
      18months I had paid it all off.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result I am now free to do something such as dev academy in which I
      can take time to earn a qualification and find a full-filling Vocation.
      Not to mention one day afford to travel as well as support my creative
      outlets.
    </p>

    <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>

    <p>
      Being part of the Avatar network wasn’t all bad. One way in which that
      culture has influenced me is that I very rarely find myself in conflict
      with others, I am always willing to look at my own actions and first
      consider where I am at fault before criticising others.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been lucky to meet some very skilled professional musicians. Being
      part of a music scene meant that I adopted a lot of their values. The main
      one being that Endeavouring to reach your full potential within your
      creative outlet is what is most fulfilling in life. That if you are
      creative then that part of you will never die and neglecting it will only
      bring you sadness. Honouring it and letting it out will bring you joy like
      nothing else can.

      Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and
      career development

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <br />

    <h4>People skills</h4>

    <p>
      Throughout my time doing the Avatar workshops as well as working in
      Banking Customer Service I have developed strong people skills. More
      specifically making people feel at ease, understanding in detail what
      their concerns are and communicating in a way that brings about a
      resolution. I feel as though I am enjoyable to be around and am capable of
      having a laugh but also know when it’s time to be serious and get the job
      done. I can see these skills coming in useful during bootcamp when I will
      have to work closely with a group under pressure and against the clock.
    </p>

    <h4>Creativity/Innovation</h4>

    <p>
      Writing recording and producing pop music has meant honing my creative and
      critical thinking skills. I have developed the ability to come up with
      ideas under pressure as well as critically review an idea in order to
      improve it. These skills seem to be quite relevant in their own way to
      programming in that one has to use their existing knowledge to come up
      with a creative solution and then go onto refine it into it’s best form. I
      can see this coming in useful when thinking up ideas for projects as well
      as finding a solution to major technical obstacles.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>Attention Span, Discipline, Consistency</h3>

    <p>
      Maintaining focus for long periods is something I can definitely improve
      on as well as maintaining a more consistent work ethic. I am capable of
      being productive when I am motivated but I need to develop the strength of
      will to get back in the zone even when I’m not so enthusiastic.
    </p>

      Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey
      and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
    </h2>
    <br />

    <h3>People Skills</h3>

    <p>
      More people will be willing to help me, i can communicate well when I have
      a question.
    </p>

    <h3>Creativity</h3>

    <p>
      Generating new ideas out of existing concepts in my head. This will help a
      lot when problems arise that need solving.
    </p>

      Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
      productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the
      strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
      reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

    <br />

    <h3>Making a song a day</h3>

    <p>
      Recently a friend and I got together and set ourselves the challenge of
      writing and recording a song per day over the period of four days. One
      common problem that would come up was differences between us in beliefs
      about how music should be made. I would often want to record everything
      from scratch and focus more heavily on music theory. Where as, my friend
      was more prepared to use pre-made loops and focus more on the audio
      production side of things. A strategy we used at the time was that if we
      couldn’t do it quickly enough to finish the song in a day then we were
      over thinking it and needed to simplify things. You could say we adopted a
      “Not yet” approach when we were concerned about our level of musicianship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back on it I would lean even further toward simplifying my ideas
      for songs. Great Pop songs are always very very simple when it comes to
      whats going on musically but just because it’s simple doesn’t mean its
      stupid. I would be less emotionally attached to the outcome and treat the
      experience as a process of discovery as apposed to searching for a
      particular outcome.
