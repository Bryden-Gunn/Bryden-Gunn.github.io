    <h1>how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h1>
    <p>
      Life is inherently unfair. No matter who you are, you have probably had
      experiences in your childhood or early adulthood that messed with your
      sense of self esteem, your sense of safety, you’re sense of belonging in
      your community and your sense of capability to take on new challenges and
      reap the rewards of hard work. Even if from the outside your life could
      have looked ideal there could always be those silent solitary and
      unconventional struggles that plague your experience of being human.
      <br /><br />Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity offers you the
      reassurance that no matter what situation you were born into in this
      world, you can slowly inch your way toward the situation that you hoped
      for. As long as you are prepared to fully own your past and the ways in
      which it disadvantaged you the burden of it can, bit by bit, be lifted
      from you and you can create an experience of life for yourself that is
      truly your own
    </p>
    <h2>
      How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will be engaging in the principles of neuroplasticity for the benefit of
      both my professional and personal life. In relation to learning to program
      I will make a habit of attempting problems/projects that are just beyond
      my capability. Aiming to continually push the limit of my skills by
      attempting problems that stretch me will keep me in the zone of proximal
      development. Staying in this zone on a regular basis will no doubt
      increase my ability to continue learning throughout my career. For
      instance: once EDA is finished, set a goal of doing ten additional
      projects. Each involving a new technology that I will likely be using in
      the type of junior role I hope to land.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as my personal life goes I hope to keep improving my social skills
      by getting out of my comfort zone and going to all sorts of events/meetups
      and interacting with as many people as I can. I am considering moving to a
      new city once I graduate. Generating meaningful new connections and
      turning interesting strangers into new friends does absolute wonders for
      my self esteem and sense of hope for my future. I plan to prove to myself
      repeatedly in small ways over time that I am worthy of having a tight
      friend group, a great relationship and can make a meaningful contribution
      to my community.
    </p>
    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      Engage in more effort based reward activities. Type two fun you could say.
      Strenuous exercise, reading books, in person group activities, working
      with your hands. Activities that put effort before reward. As apposed to,
      excessive drinking, excessive smart phone use, unhealthy food, staying
      sedentary in your room all day and not leaving the house. It could be
      boiled down to the simple idea of taking the path of most resistance.
      Doing all the things that you do not want to do, but you really know you
      should.

      >A summary of “make it stick” a book about effective learning
      techniques</a
    >
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4rP8CGaVDY "
      >A summary of “Range” a book about the value of breadth of knowledge,
      about having a wide range of skills as a apposed over specialisation</a
    >
    <h2>Growth mindset</h2>
    <p>
      Having a Growth mindset is about having an attitude that leans toward
      challenging experiences that help you grow. Reducing the need for
      validation of ones existing skills and instead being prepared to double
      down on ones weaknesses in order to improve. The less you are caught up in
      the idea of trying to prove that your gifted or special in some way and
      accepting that you are more or less like everyone else. That everyone has
      the ability to learn but it’s the ones that put in the hard work that
      ultimately end up doing something meaningful with their skills. It’s about
      choosing to be excited by new challenges and having faith that as long as
      you take the time to understand, demystify, break down problems into
      smaller parts and set realistic short term goals that you will eventually
      get it and become competent. It’s important because it’s the difference
      between reaching your full potential or living a life so comfortable that
      you never got to find out what you were capable of.

      I will be incorporating the core ideas of make it stick into my coding
      practice. Self quizzing, interleaving and spacing effect. What I hope to
      do is increase my memory recall and become less and less reliant on the
      previous solutions people have found on stack overflow. I hope to be more
      original and genuinely come up with my own solutions to problems.<br /><br />
      I will also embrace the ideas of Range. By this I mean embrace the fact
      that I have tried so many things throughout my life and use that to my
      advantage. I will use the concepts that I have learned while learning a
      musical instrument, working in a woodworking shop, working in a bank,
      studying film production and apply them to programming. This is something
      I was anxious about in regards to finding a job after dev academy, but now
      I know how I can present my previous work and life experience as evidence
      that I have “range” and that that is what will make me valuable to a
      company in the long run.
