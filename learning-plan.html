    <H1>Foundations Learning Plan</H1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

    <p>
      Long term my goal is to become a highly skilled full-stack developer
      capable of working at a senior level. I hope to take my skills overseas,
      experience working remotely and overall create a full-filling professional
      and personal life for myself.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <h4>Creativity/Innovation</h4>

    <p>
      Writing recording and producing pop music has meant honing my creative and
      critical thinking skills. I have developed the ability to come up with
      ideas under pressure as well as critically review an idea in order to
      improve it. These skills seem to be quite relevant in their own way to
      programming in that one has to use their existing knowledge to come up
      with a creative solution and then go onto refine it into it’s best form. I
      can see this coming in useful when thinking up ideas for projects as well
      as finding a solution to major technical obstacles.
    </p>

    <h4>People skills</h4>

    <p>
      Throughout my time doing the Avatar workshops as well as working in
      Banking Customer Service I have developed strong people skills. More
      specifically making people feel at ease, understanding in detail what
      their concerns are and communicating in a way that brings about a
      resolution. I feel as though I am enjoyable to be around and am capable of
      having a laugh but also know when it’s time to be serious and get the job
      done. I can see these skills coming in useful during bootcamp when I will
      have to work closely with a group under pressure and against the clock.
    </p>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>

    <h4>Attention Span, Academic ability, discipline, consistency</h4>

    <p>
      Maintaining focus for long periods is something I can definitely improve
      on as well as maintaining a more consistent work ethic. I am capable of
      being productive when I am motivated but I need to develop the strength of
      will to get back in the zone even when I’m not so enthusiastic.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I would like to develop my leadership skills. I have always been reluctant
      to be the centre of attention or take control of a situation. Whenever I
      have overcome this though I have been told I have a great leadership
      style. I want to further develop this in order to take on further
      responsibilities as I’m starting out in my career.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wish to develop my public speaking skills. Again this stems from being
      reluctant to be the centre of attention normally but being a captivating
      speaker will not only help me in my career but also greatly help me in my
      personal life as well.
    </p>

    <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>

    <p>
      While at dev academy and into my future working life I will develop the
      habit of putting my personal life aside, staying off my phone and
      remaining completely focused on the task at hand. Aside from emergencies I
      will treat my study and workload as the number one priority on which to
      focus my attention. I will contribute to an inclusive tech environment by
      treating all other students, industry/community representatives and future
      colleagues with the utmost professionalism and respect. Regardless of
      their ethnicity, religion, world views, gender and/or sexual orientation.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I will take stock of where I am focusing my attention and make sure I have
      my priorities right. I will make sure I am in a fit state mentally and
      physically by catching up on sleep and eating well. Once I am sure I have
      my house in order I will make a realistic plan as to how I will get on top
      of the workload. Wether that be relieving myself of commitments outside of
      work or putting in extra hours in order to catch up.
    </p>

    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>

    <p>
      If I find myself needing help, wether in a technical capacity or in a
      personal capacity I will not hesitate to contact my tutors. I will keep in
      mind that my tutors only wish for me to succeed and therefore will be
      happy to offer help if I ask.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>

    <p>
      I would expect that the Facilitation team make every reasonable effort to
      help me on my learning journey, see me graduate dev academy and find
      employment in the tech sector in the following months after graduation. I
      realise that a job is not guaranteed but I would hope that my Facilitators
      return the same effort that I put in.
    </p>
    <h2>Any scheduling information</h2>
    <p>
      I am fortunate that I do not have any responsibilities outside of taking
      care of myself. Throughout the rest of foundations I plan to work approx.
      40hrs pw during normal business hours. Into bootcamp I am prepared be
      working as much as it would require for me to not only complete my course
      work but distinguish myself amongst my cohort and land a role following
      graduation.
    </p>
<h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

<h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

<p>
  Long term I am interested in potential business ideas in the AI and Machine learning space.I am also interested in the 3D graphics and game development world. I’m curious to see what IP can be produced that is a valuable product. I am planning to move to Melbourne after graduating and I’m hoping to land my first role there soon after.
</p>

<h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

<p>I think innovation and creative problem solving will be my greatest strength. I am really looking forward to working closely with a team and generating new ideas. My weaknesses during bootcamp will be organisation and discipline. The longer hours will be difficult for me to maintain. I will have to remain diligent to stay up to date with all my work. </p>

<h2>
  What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
</h2>

<p>I think it will be developing discernment around when to take control of a situation and when to let others take the lead. I have previously been too outspoken during group projects while studying and so learning to not get carried a way and assume it is my place to take control all the time will be a real challenge. </p>

<h2>
  What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
</h2>
<p>I would like to develop my public speaking skills and my initiative. I would like to be more at ease in front of a group as well as develop a greater habit of doing things on my own accord as apposed to doing only what is expected of me.  </p>
<h2>
  What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
</h2>
<p>
  Support looks like pointing me in the right direction when I’m in need of help. Making an effort to make me aware of the industries best practices with the particular problem I’m working on and making ever reasonable effort to help me get prepared for the job search and land a role following graduation. 
</p>
<h2>
  What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
</h2>
<p>
  During bootcamp I will always be punctual and present at every class. I will stay on campus until my work for the day is up to date. I will make sure I eat well, get enough sleep and pace myself through out the day. I will make sure to develop a good connection to my cohort by making an effort to get to know them.
