  <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
    I learnt how fragile my ego is and how to notice when it’s getting the better of me. Now I’m more aware of when I’m comparing myself to others and feel the need to be the best in a group. I have learnt when to adopt a growth mindset and focus more time on my weaknesses as apposed to re iterating areas that I’m competent in. Finally I have learnt that it’s ok to be talkative in a group and offer help to others, even if I don’t feel that I’m qualified, my point of view can help others understand ideas that are difficult for them. 
  </p>
  <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
  <p>
    These things keep us grounded and down to earth. Without these things we can found ourselves plateauing and not progressing, or we can find ourselves in needless personality conflicts that don’t help anyone involved. Staying true to your values ensures that you continue to grow beyond your ego and stay fulfilled in your work long-term.   
  </p>
  <h3>
    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I am surprised at my ability to complete written assignments. Through out school I always found it difficult to produce decent written work but in discussing these topics I find that I can produce content that I am proud of.
  </p>
  <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
    Remaining accountable and being prepared to genuinely do the work on your weakest areas. Also looking back on your own life and how it has shaped your values. It is difficult to reflect on these things when there is pain connected to these memories, also it is easy to take for granted your experiences and not keep in mind that others lives could have been in complete contrast to yours.
  </p>
  <h3>
  Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
  </h3>
  <p>It is clear that non-technical human skills are what employers are looking for in new employees. The core learning and human skills element to Dev Academy is what sets it apart from other training organisations. It is what will ultimately set us up to be highly employable after graduating.</p>
  <h3>
  Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
  </h3>
  <p>No at all, even though it is time consuming, there are few chances in life to reflect on these things properly and in doing so can enrich our professional and personal lives by doing so. Even though we work with computers, we are not computers ourselves. Considering ourselves as whole people will ensure that we are happy and successful in our future careers. </p>
