    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript fundamentals</h1>
    <p>
      Javascript is the crucial piece needed, along with HTML and CSS, that
      makes possible the dynamic, functional and somewhat intelligent
      applications that we use in our daily lives. Without Javascript (or a
      language like it) services like Trademe or Internet Banking couldn’t
      exist.

      For example, Simply adding an item to your watch-list requires that you
      first have a profile to attribute this watch-list item to. Not to mention
      display a tick next to it as well as notify the seller that another user
      has added their item to their watch-list. This is but the tip of the
      iceberg of complexity here but you get the picture.
    </p>

        id="trademe2"

        alt="trademe screenshot"
      />
      <img
        id="trademe3"
        src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/trademe-3.png"

      />
    </div>

      Think of it like a game of cards. HTML and CSS could be used to dictate
      what each card is called, what suit each card is and what they all look
      like. Javascript however is the language that gives meaning to each card
      within the game. The underlying logic or rules of the game would be
      written in Javascript.
    </p>

      One important factor in programming is the order in which things are
      written. This is known as “Control Flow”. Generally a computer will read
      code from top to bottom like reading a book. However there are ways in
      which this can be changed. For instance, you can make the computer repeat
      a certain section of code a number of times before moving on. This is
      known as a “Loop”. More on loops in a moment. You can also make the
      computer choose between one pathway or another depending on a certain
      condition. This is know as an “if statement”. So I would think of Control
      flow almost like a toy train set. You can make that train repeat a certain
      section of track a number of times before it continues back onto the
      mainline. You could make the train choose one of two different lines to go
      down depending on how many carriages it is pulling.
    </p>

      alt="toy train"
    />
    <p>
      Now to Revisit Loops. One handy thing that we can make the computer do is
      repeat a task a number of times before moving on. This is known as a Loop.
      In this example I am making the computer count from 1 to 10 and write the
      number out every time around until it reaches 10. As you can imagine doing
      this is with a loop is far more convenient than doing it manually.
      Especially if, for instance, you had to count to 1000.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DOM could be thought of as “the HTML document from Javascript’s point
      of view”. Or perhaps “Javascript’s personal map around the HTML file” In
      order for us to see what javascript is doing it needs to be rendered on
      the webpage. In order for us to do this we need to manipulate one or more
      of the HTML elements. For instance change the text inside it, change the
      colour of it or make it disappear all together. The DOM allows us to do
      this by giving us a standardised way to tell Javascript which HTML
      element/s to take hold of and what to do with them. <br /><br />
      Here is an example where I tell the javascript to change the color of the
      h1 text to Blue. The function document.getElementById("heading") means
      “look for the HTML element with the Identifier of heading” and the
      “.style.color = "blue”;” means "change the color of the text to blue".
    </p>
    <img
      id="dom-manipulation"
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/DOM-manipulation-demo.png"
      alt="DOM DOM-manipulation-demo"
    />
    <p>
      Two very useful tools in Javascript are arrays and objects. Arrays could
      be thought of as more like lists. Where as objects could be thought of as
      more like spreadsheets. An example of an array could be this list of
      fruits:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/array-example.png"
      alt="Array example"
      id="fruits-array1"
    />
    <p>
      An example of an object could be a record of this person John including
      their age and eye color:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/object-example.png"
      alt="object example"
      id="object-example"
    />
    <p>
      But often you will have multiple objects together ie a list of people
      which also details their name, age and eye colour. Putting this list
      together could be done by creating objects within objects. For example:
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/multiple-objects-example.png"
      alt="Multiple objects example"
      id="object-example2"
    />
    <p>
      Accessing data from within an array or an object is a common task
      performed by Javascript. Each data type has their own method for accessing
      the information within. From within an array you specify what’s known as
      the ‘index’ of the array or in simpler terms the position of the item in
      the list. for example: fruits[1] accesses the second item in the list of
      fruits (array indexes start counting from 0 as apposed to 1).
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/accessing-data-array.png"
      alt="Accessing data from an aray"
      id="array-access-example"
    />
    <p>
      From within an object it could be thought of as similar to a file path ie
      “documents/pictures/family-photos/picnic.png” but slightly different
      syntax. For example: listOfPeople.Steven.eyeColor accesses the eyeColor
      property from within the Steven object from within the listOfPeople
      object. you can see how this would be useful when creating applications
      that are dependant on a set of data.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/object-access-example.png"
      alt="Accessing data from an object"
      id="object-access-example"
    />
    <p>
      Lastly I will talk about functions. The best analogy I can think of for
      this is managing a barista in a cafe. Every time a customer orders a flat
      white the last thing you would want to have to do is explain to the
      Barista each step in detail that is involved in making a flat white. They
      should already remember those steps and execute them from memory without
      thinking about it. The same goes for functions in Javascript. Instead of
      repeating yourself when writing code you can store a set of instructions
      inside a function and every time that function is “called”, or triggered
      you could say, the computer will execute those steps. For example: Here
      the multiply function is multiplying 5 by 5 and giving me the answer. I
      have made the computer do this four times.
    </p>
    <img
      id="function-example"
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/function-example.png"
      alt="example of a function"
    />
    <p>
      Furthermore this also makes it easier to change the instructions for the
      function should you need to. Say for instance in the cafe you decide that
      you would like to automatically add 1 sugar to every flat white sold. You
      would only want to have to tell the barista once. As apposed to having to
      remind them every time to add the sugar. The same goes for functions. The
      changes you make inside a function will now be applied every time that
      function gets triggered afterwards. For example: Here i have changed the
      function to multiply 5 by 25 instead. And in turn the computer gives us
      the new answer four times.
    </p>
    <img
      id="change-function-example"
      src="/content/images/JS-fundamentals/funciton-change-example.png"
      alt="Change function example"
    />
    <p>
      In summary these are but a few of the capabilities of Javascript and I am
      far from learning the full extent of the language. With these few
      capabilities however, much can be achieved.
