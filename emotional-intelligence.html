    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is being cognisant and for the most part able to
      gain control of one’s own emotions. Enough so, that in most given
      situations you are less likely to let your emotions get the better of you.
      On the contrary you are able to respond more effectively as well as more
      likely to allow challenging situations to help you grow and develop as a
      person. For instance being given constructive feedback by your employer.
      This could be quite painful for the ego to hear but if taken on board
      without offence could be greatly beneficial to you and your career
      development.

    <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      IQ only accounts for a certain portion of who we are. If we didn’t live in
      an imperfect and unpredictable world which involved working with other
      people then those with simply the highest IQ could potentially come out on
      top. Emotional intelligence could be thought of as everything that sits
      outside what is purely logical. It could be thought of as everything that
      is dynamic, has context and requires nuance to be understood.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      At the end of the day the products that we build must have an impact on
      people and so it is people that we must understand not just the specifics
      of coding in order to be successful. Unless we plan on launching our own
      company and running it ourselves as soon as we graduate we must first
      succeed at working for someone else. This will undoubtably involve working
      in a team as well as taking instructions from an employer and emotional
      intelligence will be one of our greatest assets here.
